Front-end Nanodegree Project 6 - Feed Reader Testing
This project tested my ability to use a testing suite, like Jasmine, to validate my code. We started with a Feed Reader App and were required to write test spec in Jasmine.

Steps to run application
To start the app, open index.html in your browser.

The tests were written in the feedreader.js file. The test results appears at the bottom of the index.html page.

Tests that are green have passed and red have failed.
